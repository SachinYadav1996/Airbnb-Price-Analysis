# Airbnb Price Prediction & Market Insights

A statistical analysis and machine learning project to identify the primary drivers of rental pricing and provide actionable recommendations for hosts.

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze Airbnb listing data to understand which factors most significantly influence rental prices. By identifying these drivers, the project provides data-backed strategies for hosts to optimize their revenue and for the platform to improve user satisfaction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation), Statsmodels (Linear Regression), Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning), Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization).
* **Statistical Techniques:** Log-scale transformations, Univariate and Bivariate analysis, Multiple Linear Regression.

## 🚀 Key Engineering & Analytical Highlights
* **Data Transformation:** Implemented **Log-scale transformations** on rental prices to address data skewness, ensuring the reliability of the statistical models.
* **Feature Analysis:** Quantified the impact of property features (capacity, bedrooms, bathrooms) and host policies (cancellation, booking type) on market value.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Developed a regression model that identifies key areas for revenue optimization.

## 📊 Results & Business Insights
* **Strongest Price Drivers:** Identified that property capacity and specific room types (Entire Home/Apartment) are the most significant predictors of higher rental costs.
* **Policy Impact:** Discovered that "Strict" cancellation policies and "Instant Bookable" settings generally lead to higher price points.
* **Strategic Recommendations:** * **For Hosts:** Maximize guest capacity and prioritize maintaining high review scores for premium pricing.
    * **For Platforms:** Promote "Instant Bookable" and highly-rated properties to enhance both host revenue and guest satisfaction.

## 💡 Key Learnings
* Mastered the application of statistical transformations to handle non-normal data distributions.
* Gained experience in translating complex model outputs into clear, actionable business recommendations for stakeholders.
* Refined the end-to-end data science workflow from exploratory analysis to model interpretation
